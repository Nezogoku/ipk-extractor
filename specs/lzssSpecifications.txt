COMPRESSED CHUNKS
    Data buffer with size 4069
    8 flag bits, 8-16 data bytes
    
    FLAG
        1 is raw byte
        0 is copy address + copy counter from following short (0xABCD)
            ADDRESS:
            Add 12 bits from short in LE (0x0CAB) to constructed address
                AND out least-significant nibble in least-significant byte
                Nibbles in least-significant byte are then swapped
            
            COUNTER:
            Add 4 bits from short in BE (0x000D) to constructed counter
        
        If amount bits greater than remaining data bytes, leave remaining as 0
    
    DATA BYTES
        FLAG 1
            Raw is 0xAB
            Raw added to data buffer (wrap-around)
        FLAG 0
            Copy address is 0x0CAB
            Counter is 0x000D
            
            COUNTER:
                LOOP COUNTER + 3 TIMES:
                    Copied from data buffer is 0xAB
                    Copied added to data buffer (wrap-around)
                    Increment copy address and destination address by 1
