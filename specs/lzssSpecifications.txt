COMPRESSED CHUNKS
    8 flag bits, 8-16 data bytes
    
    FLAG
        1 is raw byte
        0 is copy address + copy counter from following short (0xABCD)
            ADDRESS:
            12 Most-significant bits from short to constructed address (0x0CAB)
                4 least-significant bits moved to front 
                Add 18 (max copy size), modulo 4096 (max buffer size)
            
            COUNTER:
            4 Least-significant bits from short (0x000D) to constructed counter
        
        If amount bits greater than remaining data bytes, leave remaining as 0
    
    DATA BYTES
        FLAG 1
            Raw is 0xAB
        FLAG 0
            Copy address is (0x0CAB + 18) % 4096
            Counter is 0x000D
            
            COUNTER:
                LOOP COUNTER + 3 TIMES:
                    New address is ((address - destination address) % 4096) + destination address - 4096
                    
                    NEW ADDRESS < 0:
                        Raw byte is 0x00
                    NEW ADDRESS >= 0:
                        Copied from data buffer is 0xAB
                    
                    Increment destination address by 1
